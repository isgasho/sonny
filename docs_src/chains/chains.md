Chains are one of the most important concepts in Sonny. Chains are to Sonny what functions are to other languages. However, using chains requires a bit of a different mindset. Chains are designed to be used like a pipline. Each link in a chain can reference previous links, so audio processing can be handled modularly, one step at a time.
