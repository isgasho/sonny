## What is Sonny?

Sonny is a functional programming language designed for generating and transforming sound. It gives the user the tools to manipulate sound waves in any way they want. What you can accomplish is Sonny is limited only by your imagination (and your grasp of algebra).

This tutorial will teach you the ins and outs of programming in Sonny. If you do not yet have Sonny installed, you can read the [installation section of the main repo's readme](https://github.com/kaikalii/sonny). It is *highly recommended* that you add the Sonny executable path to your system path so that you can run it from any directory.

Once you have Sonny installed, you can start with [generating a tone](https://github.com/kaikalii/sonny/wiki/Generating-A-Tone).
